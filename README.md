|5| [Storytelling with Data: Project  Supertsore "Tableau"]()| In this project, I analyzed a superstore's operations to boost profitability and optimize advertising strategies. I evaluated return metrics (return rates, total cost, and number of returns) to identify key issues and recommended the most useful metrics for various scenarios. I created a comprehensive dashboard featuring visualizations of profit and loss centers, product return rates, customer return behavior, and advertising effectiveness. The analysis provided actionable insights, including product discontinuation and advertising adjustments, to help the superstore improve its financial performance and make data-driven decisions.|
