Executive Summary

Conversion Rates:
Shopping Cart to Purchase (36%): The 36% conversion rate indicates that once users add items to their cart, they are very likely to complete the purchase. This suggests that the checkout process is effective and user-friendly.

View to Shopping Cart (29%): The 29% conversion rate from viewing a product to adding it to the cart suggests there is room for improvement in moving users from product views to cart additions. Enhancing product pages or adding more compelling calls to action could help increase this rate.

Overall Conversion Rate (10%): With a total conversion rate of 10%, there is significant potential to improve the transition from initial views to final purchases by addressing drop-offs between these stages.

Recommendations:
- Optimize Product Pages: Focus on enhancing the product page experience to boost the conversion rate from views to shopping carts. Consider improvements such as better product descriptions, high-quality images, or more engaging calls-to-action.
-  Refine Checkout Process: Continue refining and streamlining the checkout process to maintain or even improve the high conversion rate from carts to purchases.
- Strategic Interventions: Implement targeted strategies to reduce drop-offs between initial views and final purchases. This could include personalized recommendations, targeted promotions, or improved user engagement tactics.

Retention:
Initial Retention Decline: The highest retention rates are observed in the first month across all cohorts, with a significant decline in subsequent months. By the third and fourth months, retention rates are nearly negligible, indicating a challenge in maintaining long-term engagement.
